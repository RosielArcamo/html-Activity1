			I studied my primary education at Tinago ELmentary School and continue my secondary education at Lourdes National High School,I am major in ICT- Hardware Services,at the school I met a lot of friends and staffs that helps me to boast my confident and nurtured me not just about the lessons but also for who I am that's why I am soo much thankful to my friends and teachers in High School for giving a memorable high school life. I graduated my Senior High School life at STI College Bohol, I take IT major in Mobile App and Web Development.In this school I learned a lot even my weaknesses and strength in life. So far they have the best teachers for me and there I met my barkada and trusted 
			friend.

			In college I take the course  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology actually taking this course in college isn't my dream,I am supposed to take Civil Engeneering but the luck is not on me so I decided to take Industrial Engeneering in this school but sadly they are not offering the course.I stop BSIT for almost one year to shift Accounting or Entrepeneurship but as I reflect things I finally decided to continue the course  but I don't know if I will finish this or just proceed to Industrial Engeering next year in  other school.It is hard to leave being an IT student because I learned a lot in my previous school and this course brought me to make life exciting.
